- My project is about creating an app that helps people design their homes. The person clicks a photo of the interiors of the house through the app stating which room ex. drawing room, dining room etc. The app will then tell the appropriate way of designing your house. Ex. the app will tell you to buy a carpet of some colour for the drawing room stating the exact dimensions and also show suggestions from the internet.
- All the young adults who buy a new house or moved into a rental house are often confused as to how to decorate the house. This app will be very useful for these people. 
- The user needs to click photos of the house stating which room is what and that's it. The app will automatically process and tells the user on how to decorate the interiors of the house.
- The users can get help with my project when one buys a new house or shifts to a new reantal house.
- There will be a bunch of people who will be hired for this project and they would work on to better this project with new improvemnts and smooth functioning of the app.
